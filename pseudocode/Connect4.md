1. Create a board
    1a. Set the board to be 6*7
    1b. create columns & rows
    1c. create 42 circles that are evenly separated in a rectangle
2. Create 2 players
    2a. define player 1 & 2
    2b. assign colors to player 1 & 2
    2c. put a statement of "Player '_' Turn" under the connect 4 header
        2c. this should be a function that will alternate player turn and indicate it by a color
    2e. alternate turns with each player/ no player can go 2 times in a row
3. Create a Play again button
    3a. seperate the play again button from the board so that it's nicely seprated/presented
    3b. play again button shouldnt be allowed to be pressed until after the game is completed( i.e won/lost/tied)
    3c. 
4. set a text box that explains the rules on the side
    4a. create a button that opens the rules in a text box
    4b. set that text box on the right of the board
5. Determine the GameStatus
    5a. Winner, Loser, Tie
    5b. game ends when a palyer connects 4 of their respective color in a row
    5c. game is tied if neither player connects 4 pieces of their respective color in a row
6. Setting certain functions
    6a. prevent palyers from putting pieces anywhere they want.
    6b. ^-this function should allow the player to only play in the first row and then move upwards one row at a time
    6c. (potential idea) create a row at the top that will allow you to place a piece in a respective column
    6d. assign a color value on the left of the board that will indicate what color belongs to each palyer
    6e. (potential idea) allow players to select their own color of the board
    6f. prevent players from placing a connect 4 piece that exists in a cell already.
